# Projects

The Sparkle Candles Website, I am currently waiting for some content to be sent over to replace the lorem ipsum and some more images of there differnet scented candles, the products page will also be setup through One.com cms so they can put on the products, stock and price (Hense why there is nothing on products page other than navbar)

The Twitch Stream CSS was for a friend of mine for some alerts and will only work with StreamLabs(Software he currently uses) so I will only be able to show the code for this example.

Forgive the landing page content as this was part of the Udemy course wheir you had to make a landing page based on a screenshot and it had to be the same.
